CATROCK LICENSE
===============

Unlike all other software is one is not "provided as is".
I created it and I am reasonably responsible for it. So,
if it caused any harm feel to put me on court.
However, by this agreement the liability is to be limited by $10
(or equivalent in you local currency). Furthermore,
this amount can be repaid in kitties or even adult
cats.

So, for example, you installed this software on
your computer and it blew up. In order compensate your
loss and collateral damages I can give you a $10 cheque
OR I can give you my cat that you must take care of.
But it must be well-proven that the laptop exploded because
of this software, and not because of, e.g., bad battery
or something.

Oh, btw, by using this software or even reading the license
you accept it.
